Implementation of dual numbers


This is a work in progress. In particular, the unit tests are incomplete, and 
I am all but certain there are bugs lurking in dual.py, I found some just prior
to uploading to github. I'm not convinced I *care* in that I may never touch this
code again. Or, I might. Who knows? I mostly wanted to get it off my hard drive and
backed up to the cloud in some manner.
