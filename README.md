# Automatic Differentiation with Dual Numbers

This is a work in progress. In particular, the unit tests are incomplete, and 
I am all but certain there are bugs lurking in dual.py, I found some just prior
to uploading to github. I'm not convinced I *care* in that I may never touch this
code again. Or, I might. Who knows? I mostly wanted to get it off my hard drive and
backed up to the cloud in some manner. 

With that said, read dual_numbers.ipynb if you want to develop a basic understanding 
of how dual numbers can be used to perform automatic differentiation. Don't rely on
dual.py to be correct.
